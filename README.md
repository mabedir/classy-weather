# Classy Weather

This project is part of the Jonas React Course. It is a weather application that demonstrates the use of both class components and functional components in React.

## Additional Information

While the course primarily focuses on class components, the implementation of functional components in this project is an additional enhancement. This demonstrates the flexibility and modern practices in React development, showcasing how functional components can be integrated alongside class components.

## Features

- Fetches and displays weather data
- Utilizes both class components and functional components
- Responsive design

## Components

### Class Components

Class components are used in this project to manage state and lifecycle methods. They provide a traditional way of handling component logic and state management.

### Functional Components

Functional components are used for simpler, stateless components. With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can also manage state and side effects, making them a powerful tool in modern React development.
